This project is one of the one's mentioned on my portfolio website: https://amandacvel.github.io/AmandaCVPortfolio.github.io/AmandaVPortfolio.html
This is the Cars Project that uses SQL.

The first file contains the "Foundational Code" and the second file contains the "body" or the actual questions. 
There are plenty of comments, giving lots of details as to:
    * What I am trying to achieve
    * Next steps
    * What each section of code is doing or will do
    * Why I needed the code
    * There are some comments detailing the process I took/thoughts when typing out the code and why
    * There are some errors mentioned in the foundation. I find it a good thing to see the mistakes and to show solutions
